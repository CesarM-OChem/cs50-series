# Credit

## Text extracted from CS50:

A credit (or debit) card, of course, is a plastic card with which you can pay for goods and services. Printed on that card is a 
number that’s also stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows 
whom to bill. There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: American Express 
uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers. And those are decimal 
numbers (0 through 9), not binary, which means, for instance, that American Express could print as many as 10^15 = 
1,000,000,000,000,000 unique cards! (That’s, um, a quadrillion.)

[...]

In a file called ```credit.c``` in a folder called ```credit```, implement a program in C that checks the validity of a given credit 
card number.
