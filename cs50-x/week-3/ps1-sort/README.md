# Sort

## Self proposed problem

In the problem set of CS50 was proposed that I analyse the results in terms of time of three different sorting
algorithms without knowing which was which. I concluded that and thought that would be more interesting if I did 
a version of that three algorithms myself. So that's what I did. Read below for more informations.

## Text extracted from CS50:

Recall from lecture that we saw a few algorithms for sorting a sequence of numbers: selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort.

* Selection sort iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to
  its correct location.
  
* Bubble sort compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. This continues
  until the list is sorted.
  
* Merge sort recursively divides the list into two repeatedly and then merges the smaller lists back into a larger one in the
  correct order.
  
In this problem, youâ€™ll analyze three (compiled!) sorting programs to determine which algorithms they use. In a file called 
```answers.txt``` in a folder called ```sort```, record your answers, along with an explanation for each program, by filling in the 
blanks marked TODO.
