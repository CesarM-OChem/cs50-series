# Tideman

## To begin

Here was proposed that I complement an already existing code to finish the vote counting of a tideman election without modify
any part of the existing code. Here I was able to see a little more about what it if to extend a team's previous work.

## Text extracted from CS50:

Perhaps the simplest way to hold an election, though, is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote” (also known as 
“first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the 
election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.

[...]
  
The Tideman voting method (also known as “ranked pairs”) is a ranked-choice voting method that’s guaranteed to produce the Condorcet 
winner of the election if one exists. In a file called ```tideman.c``` in a folder called ```tideman```, create a program to simulate an election 
by the Tideman voting method.
