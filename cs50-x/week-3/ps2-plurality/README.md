## To begin

Here was proposed that I complement an already existing code to finish the vote counting of a plurality election without modify
any part of the existing code. Here I was able to see what it if to extend the previous work of a team.

## Text extracted from CS50:

Perhaps the simplest way to hold an election, though, is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote” (also known as 
“first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the 
election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.

[...]
  
This part is up to you to complete! <b>You should not modify anything else in ```plurality.c``` other than the implementations of the ```vote```
and ```print_winner``` functions (and the inclusion of additional header files, if you’d like).</b>
