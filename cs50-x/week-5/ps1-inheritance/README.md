# Inheritance

## Text extracted from CS50:

A person’s blood type is determined by two alleles (i.e., different forms of a gene). The three possible alleles are A, B, 
and O, of which each person has two (possibly the same, possibly different). Each of a child’s parents randomly passes one 
of their two blood type alleles to their child. The possible blood type combinations, then, are: OO, OA, OB, AO, AA, AB, BO, 
BA, and BB.

[...]

In a file called ```inheritance.c``` in a folder called ```inheritance```, simulate the inheritance of blood types for each member of 
a family.
