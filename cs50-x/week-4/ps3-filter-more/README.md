# Filter More

## Text extracted from CS50:

Perhaps the simplest way to represent an image is with a grid of pixels (i.e., dots), each of which can be of a different 
color. For black-and-white images, we thus need 1 bit per pixel, as 0 could represent black and 1 could represent white, 
as in the below.

<div align="center">
  <img width="400px" src="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/4/filter/more/bitmap.png">
</div>

In a file called ```helpers.c``` in a folder called ```filter-more```, write a program to apply filters to BMPs.
