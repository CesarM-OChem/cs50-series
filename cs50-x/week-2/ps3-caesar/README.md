# Caesar

## Text extracted from CS50:

Supposedly, Caesar (yes, that Caesar) used to “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) confidential 
messages by shifting each letter therein by some number of places. For instance, he might write A as B, 
B as C, C as D, …, and, wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A. And so, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar 
might write IFMMP instead. Upon receiving such messages from Caesar, recipients would have to 
“decrypt” them by shifting letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places.

[...]

In a file called ```caesar.c``` in a folder called ```caesar```, write a program that enables you to encrypt 
messages using Caesar’s cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should decide, by 
providing a command-line argument, what the key should be in the secret message they’ll provide at 
runtime. We shouldn’t necessarily assume that the user’s key is going to be a number; though you may 
assume that, if it is a number, it will be a positive integer.
