# Scrabble

## Text extracted from CS50:

In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of 
the point values of each letter in the word.

[...]

In a file called ```scrabble.c``` in a folder called ```scrabble```, implement a program in C that determines the 
winner of a short Scrabble-like game. Your program should prompt for input twice: once for “Player 1” 
to input their word and once for “Player 2” to input their word. Then, depending on which player scores 
the most points, your program should either print “Player 1 wins!”, “Player 2 wins!”, or “Tie!” (in the event the two players score equal points).
