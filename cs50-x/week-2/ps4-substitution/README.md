# Substitution

## Text extracted from CS50:

In a substitution cipher, we “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) a message by replacing every 
letter with another letter. To do so, we use a key: in this case, a mapping of each of the letters of the 
alphabet to the letter it should correspond to when we encrypt it. To “decrypt” the message, the 
receiver of the message would need to know the key, so that they can reverse the process: translating 
the encrypt text (generally called ciphertext) back into the original message (generally called plaintext).

[...]

In a file called ```substitution.c``` in a folder called ```substitution```, create a program that enables you to 
encrypt messages using a substitution cipher. At the time the user executes the program, they should 
decide, by providing a command-line argument, on what the key should be in the secret message 
they’ll provide at runtime.
