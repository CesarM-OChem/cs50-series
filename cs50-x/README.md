# This is CS50!

This is a course of Harvard University that brings the basics of Computer Science with ```lectures``` ministred 
by professor [David Malan](https://github.com/dmalan), a set of ```shorts``` that brings the topics of the lecture in a simpler way with new 
examples, a ```section```, that is a recorded live where a colaborator answers questions of students about the 
problem set of the week and, finally but not less important, the ```problem set```, that is a list of a few 
programs to be solved in order to put in practice all the knowledge of the lecture.

The course also includes a ```final project```, where the students can show all knowledge aquired.
